# Graph-Theory-Project
This Analytical Project was done for CSO-323: Graph Theory and Applications open elective taken by [Dr. Vignesh](https://www.profile.iitbhu.ac.in/vignesh.cse/).
<br>
<br>
The dataset used here is the Protein Dataset wherein the nodes are the protein molecules and the edges connecting them are the interaction amongst them. The analysis performed here is mainly based on the network structure and topology of this dataset along with its corresponding scale-free network properties. Along with this various aspects like communities, and connected components present in it are studied.
<br>
From the analysis few interesting points are;
<br>
<br>
This is a scale-free network as the degree distribution curve is extremely rightly skewed. It is a sparse graph with HUBS as suggested by its average degree and density.
<br>
<br>
It has undirected and unweighted edges with nodes having self-loops and a few connected components. It has a few isolated components as well since its minimum degree is zero. 
<br>
<br>
Its average path length coupled with degree distribution and network diameter suggests that the few nodes are really far away from each other while some are close to each other. Closeness and eccentricity plots also suggest the same.
<br>
<br>
There are a lot of communities based on the Modularity index with some of them containing large members while some of them having a few members. Central nodes have usually large members in communities and edges have fewer. Closeness and eccentricity plots also suggest the same.
